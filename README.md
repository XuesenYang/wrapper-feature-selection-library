The original brainstorming algorithm and several improved brainstorming algorithms are used for feature selection problems, and 16 test classifications can be selected for testing.    
Put the test data file in a folder and name'dataset', run'BFOFS.m','PPBSOFS.m' .etc, and you'll get the experimental results about the classification accuracy.
