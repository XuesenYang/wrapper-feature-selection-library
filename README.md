# Evolutionary-computation(EC)-algorithms-for-feature-selection
The original brainstorming algorithm and several improved brainstorming algorithms are used for feature selection problems, and 16 test classifications can be selected for testing.    
Put the test data file in a folder and name'dataset', run'BFOFS.m','PPBSOFS.m' .etc, and you'll get the experimental results about the classification accuracy.
