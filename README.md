The original brainstorming algorithm and several improved brainstorming algorithms are used for feature selection problems, and 16 test classifications can be selected for testing.
Put the test data file in a folder and name'dataset', run'bsofs.m','PPBSOFS.m','CLbsofs.m','MBSOFSV1.m','MBSOFSV2.m', and you'll get the experimental results about the classification accuracy.
